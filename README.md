# Retail Price Optimization Application

A Python application that uses machine learning to optimize retail prices.

## Project Overview

The Retail Price Optimization Application is designed to help retailers determine the optimal pricing for their products, maximizing revenue and profitability. By leveraging historical sales data and various product features, the application predicts the best possible price using machine learning techniques.

### Technologies used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Heroku (for deployment)

### Application Features

1. **Data preprocessing**: The application processes raw retail data, cleaning and transforming it into a suitable format for further analysis.
2. **Feature engineering**: It identifies and creates new features that can help improve the performance of the machine learning model.
3. **Model development and evaluation**: The core algorithm is implemented using the RandomForestRegressor from the Scikit-learn library. The application also employs cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
4. **User interface**: A simple Flask-based web application allows users to input product features, and the application predicts the optimized price in real-time.

## Usage

To use the Retail Price Optimization Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Flask).
3. Run the `app.py` file in the `src` directory to start the local Flask server.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
5. Input the required product features and submit the form. The application will display the predicted optimized price.
